Postmortem Report: Nginx Web Server Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:

Start: June 29, 2024, 17:00 EAT
End: June 29, 2024, 18:00 EAT
Impact:

Service Affected: Main website experienced high failure rates under load.
User Experience: Approximately 50% of users faced slow or unresponsive website access.
Root Cause: Incorrect configuration of the Nginx server, leading to high failure rates when handling concurrent requests.
Timeline
17:00 EAT: Issue detected by automated monitoring system indicating high rates of failed HTTP requests.
17:05 EAT: Alert received by the on-call engineer.
17:10 EAT: Initial investigation started; assumed issue was due to server capacity.
17:20 EAT: Misleading investigation of server hardware and network configurations.
17:30 EAT: Incident escalated to the web infrastructure team.
17:40 EAT: Incorrect Nginx configuration discovered.
17:45 EAT: Applied Puppet script to correct Nginx configuration.
17:50 EAT: Re-ran load test and observed zero failed requests.
18:00 EAT: Confirmed resolution and closed the incident.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The Nginx server was improperly configured to handle high concurrency, leading to a significant number of length errors in the responses. This misconfiguration caused 943 out of 2000 requests to fail during the load test.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by applying a Puppet script (0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp) that corrected the Nginx configuration. The script adjusted parameters to handle concurrent requests properly, eliminating length errors and ensuring the server could efficiently manage the load.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Configuration Management: Implement better practices to prevent misconfigurations.
Monitoring and Alerts: Enhance monitoring to detect similar issues earlier with more detailed diagnostics.
Documentation: Update documentation to include correct Nginx configuration for high concurrency.
Tasks:

Patch Nginx Server: Ensure all servers are running the corrected configuration.
Add Monitoring on Server Memory: Implement monitoring for server memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks.
Review Configuration Management: Conduct a thorough review of configuration management practices to prevent future issues.
Update Incident Response Plan: Improve the incident response plan to include steps for quickly identifying and fixing configuration issues.
Training: Provide additional training for engineers on handling high-concurrency configurations and using monitoring tools effectively.
By addressing these measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure our web server can handle high traffic loads without issues.
